# Custom Token Contract

A simple Solidity smart contract that implements a custom ERC20 token with additional functionalities.

## Description

This project contains a Solidity smart contract that deploys a custom ERC20 token called "PRIYANSHU" with the symbol "PRY". The contract extends the OpenZeppelin's ERC20 standard contract and includes features like token minting, token burning, and secure token transfers. The contract also utilizes the Ownable contract from OpenZeppelin to manage ownership and access control.

## Features

- Mint new tokens and send them to a specified recipient using the `mintTokens` function.
- Burn a certain amount of your own tokens using the `burnTokens` function.
- Securely transfer tokens to another address using the `transfer` function.

## Getting Started

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

### Executing program

1. Open a development environment or IDE that supports Solidity smart contracts (e.g., Remix or Visual Studio Code with Solidity extension).
2. Compile the `CustomToken.sol` contract using the appropriate Solidity compiler version (0.8.0 or compatible).
3. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain network (e.g., Remix's JavaScript VM or a public testnet).
4. Interact with the deployed contract using its functions and methods.

## Usage

- Use the `mintTokens` function to mint new tokens and send them to a specified recipient.
- Use the `burnTokens` function to burn a certain amount of your own tokens.
- Use the `transfer` function to securely transfer tokens to another address.
